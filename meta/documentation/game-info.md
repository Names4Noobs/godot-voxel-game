>**NOTE:** The game is in an early state. Core gameplay features could be removed or alterted significantly.

## Plans

Here are some plans to do with the game. These are not set in stone.

### Multiplayer
I plan on having this game be multiplayer, however, singleplayer is the priority right now. 
The structure of the game is not multiplayer friendly so adding multiplayer will be a lot of work.


### Features
This game is planned to be an open world survival voxel game, like Minecraft, but with an emphasis on player progression.

Here are some gameplay features which will help accomplish this:
- Fast player movement 
- Emphasis on world exploration
- Low emphasis on base building in the early game
- Large amount of player storage
- Intricate leveling system with different skills
- Give the player tools to modify the world on a large scale (ex. terraforming)
