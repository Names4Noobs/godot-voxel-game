>**NOTE:** Currently the game is in an early state. Core gameplay features could be removed or alterted significantly.

## Plans

This game is planned to be an open world survival voxel game, like Minecraft, but with an emphasis on player progression.

Here are some gameplay features which will help accomplish this:
- Fast player movement 
- Emphasis on world exploration
- Low emphasis on base building in the early game
- Large amount of player storage
- Intricate leveling system with different skills
- Give the player tools to modify the world on a large scale (ex. terraforming)
