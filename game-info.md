>**NOTE:** Currently the game is in an early state. Core gameplay features could be removed or alterted significantly.

## Plans

This game is planned to be an open world survival voxel game, like Minecraft, but with an emphasis on player progression.

Here are some gameplay features which will help accomplish this:
- Fast player movement 
- Emphasis on world exploration
- Low emphasis on building bases in the early game
- Large amount of player storage for loot
- Intricate leveling system like an mmo
- Give the player tools to modify the environment in big ways (like terraforming)
