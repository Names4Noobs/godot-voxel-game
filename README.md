# Godot Voxel Game

Voxel game using Zylann's [voxel module](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel) for Godot 4.0.

## Running the game
At the moment, you need to get a build of Godot 4 with Zylann's voxel module compiled into it. However, in the future this module should work with [GDExtension](https://godotengine.org/article/introducing-gd-extensions/), so you will not need to download an entire game engine to update the module.


The current voxel module godot engine build I am using can be found [here](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel/actions/runs/4896186134). If you are not on Windows, you need to find a github action build or compile the engine with the same commit I am using.

## Assets
I am using the [Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella) texture pack for game textures.
