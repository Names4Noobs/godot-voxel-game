# Godot Voxel Game

Voxel survival game using Zylann's [voxel module](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel) for Godot 4.0.



## How to run the game
To run the game you need to get a build of Godot 4 with Zylann's voxel module installed.
The current godot engine build I am using can be found [here](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel/actions/runs/2603605067).
