# Godot Voxel Game

This demo is using [this version](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel/releases/tag/v1.3.0) of Zylann's [voxel module](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel) for Godot 4.
If you want to build Godot with the module yourself, follow [these instructions](https://voxel-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_the_module/#building-yourself).  
More voxel module documentation can be found [here](https://voxel-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


Placeholder textures are from the [Faithful 32x texture pack](https://www.faithfulpack.net/downloads).
The license is [here](https://www.faithfulpack.net/license).  
While the code in this repo is MIT, these textures are not. As far as I can tell, I am allowed to use the textures as placeholders as long as I don't monetize this project. Someone let me know if I am wrong about that...
